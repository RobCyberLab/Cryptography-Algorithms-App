## Introduction üìò
The **Cryptography-Algorithms-App** is a web-based application that demonstrates encryption and decryption using multiple cryptographic algorithms, including **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** and **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**. This tool provides a hands-on approach to understanding the fundamentals of secure communication and data protection. The app allows users to encrypt and decrypt text securely with both symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption techniques, showcasing their real-world applications in cybersecurity.

## Technical Description ‚öôÔ∏è
The **Cryptography-Algorithms-App** features two main functionalities: text encryption and decryption. The encryption and decryption operations are performed using the following cryptographic algorithms:

- **AES**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **RSA**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

The app is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend functionality, with encryption and decryption handled by the **crypto module** (for AES) and the **NodeRSA** library (for RSA). The frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing a clean and interactive user interface. Users can select the encryption/decryption method, input their text, and view the output dynamically.

## Technologies Used üíª
- **Node.js**: For building the backend API.
- **Express.js**: To set up and handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Crypto Module**: Built-in Node.js module used for AES encryption and decryption.
- **NodeRSA**: A library used for RSA encryption and decryption.
- **Helmet.js**: Middleware for securing HTTP headers and enhancing application security.
- **express-rate-limit**: For rate limiting to protect against excessive API requests.
- **CORS**: Configured to manage cross-origin resource sharing.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the user interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To implement logic for encryption, decryption, and dynamic UI updates.

## Main Features üåü
- **AES Encryption/Decryption**: Secure encryption and decryption using AES-256-GCM.
- **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: Secure encryption and decryption using RSA with PKCS1-OAEP padding.
- **Real-Time Output**: Instant output of encrypted or decrypted text as the user interacts with the form.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when incorrect inputs are provided (e.g., invalid method selection or text format).
- **Security Enhancements**: Includes **Helmet.js** for HTTP header security and **rate limiting** to mitigate abuse.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly across different devices.

## Use Cases üîç
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypting sensitive text to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps users learn about encryption algorithms and their applications in cybersecurity.
- **Cryptography Exploration**: Ideal for experimenting with different encryption algorithms (AES and RSA).
- **Data Privacy**: Encrypting personal or confidential information before transmission.

## Results and Insights üìù
The **Cryptography-Algorithms-App** offers a practical demonstration of how both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms function. It highlights the differences in key management between AES and RSA. This project has helped improve my understanding of how cryptographic algorithms can be implemented in real-world applications and reinforced the importance of user-friendly design in security tools. Key challenges included handling various input types and ensuring that error messages were clear and helpful to users.

## Possible Improvements üöÄ
- **Support for More Algorithms**: Add support for other encryption algorithms such as **Triple DES** or **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**.
- **User Authentication**: Implement authentication to secure encryption and decryption functionality.
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Improve the user interface with features like input validation, progress indicators, and a more interactive design.
- **File Encryption**: Allow users to upload files for encryption and decryption, in addition to text input.
- **Key Management**: Implement a secure key management system to handle RSA keys more efficiently.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the app to support multiple languages and character sets for encryption.
